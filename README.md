# 🌍 Location-Based Google Form Access

This project allows access to a Google Form based on the user's location, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form is only accessible within a specific radius from a designated location (configured via latitude and longitude). This is useful for location-restricted surveys, event check-ins, or any other form requiring geolocation verification.

## ✨ Features

- 📱 **Responsive Design**: CSS styling ensures the embedded Google Form is mobile-friendly.
- 🔧 **Customizable Setup**: Easily configure the target coordinates, Google Form ID, and access radius.
